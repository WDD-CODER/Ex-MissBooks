        "description": "Molecular Food Science explores the fascinating intersection of science and cooking, revealing how understanding molecular gastronomy can revolutionize our culinary experiences. The book unveils the hidden chemistry behind textures, flavors, and aesthetics in modern cuisine, emphasizing precise control and innovation. For instance, manipulating proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids at a molecular level can lead to surprising results, like stable foams or perfectly textured gels. The book progresses from basic food chemistry to advanced techniques like spherification and sous vide, explaining the underlying chemical reactions and physical processes. It uniquely bridges the gap between the lab and the kitchen, offering practical insights for chefs and food enthusiasts. By focusing on the science behind culinary transformations, Molecular Food Science empowers readers to creatively apply this knowledge, moving beyond simple recipes to truly understand the art of cooking.",

This new edition retains the basic format and pedagogical features of previous editions and provides an up-to-date foundation upon which more advanced and specialized knowledge can be built. This essential volume introduces and surveys the broad and complex interrelationships among food ingredients, processing, packaging, distribution and storage, and explores how these factors influence food quality and safety. Reflecting recent advances and emerging technologies in the area, this new edition includes updated commodity and ingredient chapters to emphasize the growing importance of analogs, macro-substitutions, fat fiber and sugar substitutes and replacement products, especially as they affect new product development and increasing concerns for a healthier diet. Revised processing chapters include changing attitudes toward food irradiation, greater use of microwave cooking and microwaveable products, controlled and modified atmosphere packaging and expanding technologies such a extrusion cooking, ohmic heating and supercritical fluid extraction, new information that addresses concerns about the responsible management of food technology, considering environmental, social and economic consequences, as well as the increasing globalization of the food industry. Discussions of food safety an consumer protection including newer phychrotropic pathogens; HAACP techniques for product safety and quality; new information on food additives; pesticides and hormones; and the latest information on nutrition labeling and food regulation. An outstanding text for students with little or no previous instruction in food science and technology, Food Science is also a valuable reference for professionals in food processing, as well as for those working in fields that service, regulate or otherwise interface with the food industry.",

        "description": "This fifth edition of Modern Food Microbiology places special emphasis on foodborne microorganisms, as the previous four editions attempted to do. A good understanding of the basic biology offoodborne organisms is more critical for food scientists now than in previous decades. With so many microbiologists in the 1990s devoting their attention to genes and molecules, one objective of this text is to provide a work that places emphasis on entire microbial cells as well as their genes and molecules. For textbook usage, this edition is best suited for a second or subsequent course in microbiology. Although organic chemistry is a desirable prerequisite, those with a good grasp of general biology and chemistry should not find this book difficult. In addition to its use as a course text, this edition, like the previous, contains material that goes beyond what normally is covered in a one-term course. For use as a food microbiology text, suggested starting points are the sections in Chapter 2 that deal with the sources and types of microorganisms in foods followed by the principles outlined in Chapter 3. The food product chapters (Chaps. 4-9) may be covered to the extent that one wishes, but the principles from Chapters 2 and 3 should be stressed during this coverage. A somewhat logical next step would be food preservation methods as outlined in Chapters 13-17 where again the principles from Chapter 3 come into play.",
